# Goblet Squat — Coaching Reference & Gold Standard Angles
**Kinetic · Haiku Call 1 · Coaching Language Reference**
*Version 2.0 — May 2026 · Threshold alignment update*

> **Purpose:** It encodes clinically sourced angle targets, root cause drills, per-parameter coaching language,
> and exercise prescriptions. All angle ranges are in **MediaPipe interior angle convention**
> unless explicitly labelled otherwise. Smaller MediaPipe angle = more deeply bent.

## PART 1 — GOLD STANDARD ANGLE TARGETS

### 1.1 Angle Convention Reminder

| Position | MediaPipe interior | Conventional flexion |
|---|---|---|
| Standing upright | ~170–175° | ~5–10° flexion |
| Hip crease at knee level (parallel) | ~95–105° | ~75–85° flexion |
| Hip crease below knee (good depth) | ~65–90° | ~90–115° flexion |
| Full depth / ATG | ~45–65° | ~115–135° flexion |

**Conversion:** `conventional_flexion = 180 − MediaPipe_interior`

**Rule:** When coaching, always cite the MediaPipe number from the JSON (it matches the OpenCV overlay the user sees on screen). Then translate it into plain-language depth description.

---

### 1.2 Front / Angled Camera — Target Ranges

*Frontal-plane metrics (valgus, hip asymmetry, lateral shift) are primary here.
Depth angles are readable but less precise than side view.*

> ⚠️ **Ankle dorsiflexion from front camera:** Shin angle is a sagittal-plane measurement. From a front-facing camera, MediaPipe z-axis estimation is less reliable. The ⚠️ row above uses wider bands. Confirm restriction with heel lift visibility and knee valgus ratio — do not apply severity grading solely from front-camera shin angle.

| Parameter | Excellent | Good | Mild deviation | Moderate deviation | Severe deviation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Knee angle at bottom** (interior °) | 65–90° | 91–105° | 106–115° | 116–125° | 126°+ |
| **Trunk lean from vertical** (°) | 5–18° | 19–28° | 29–38° | 39–50° | 51°+ |
| **Ankle dorsiflexion** (shin from vert.) ⚠️ | ≥ 25° | 18–24° | 10–17° | 0–9° | < 0° / heel up |
| **Knee gap / hip gap ratio** | 0.98–1.15 | 0.92–0.97 | 0.85–0.91 | 0.72–0.84 | 0.00–0.71 |
| **Hip height asymmetry** (L vs R mm) | 0–4 mm | 5–8 mm | 9–14 mm | 15–22 mm | 23 mm+ |
| **Lateral trunk shift** (shoulder vs hip) | 0–1.5 cm | 1.6–3 cm | 3.1–5 cm | 5.1–7 cm | 7 cm+ |
| **Descent tempo** (eccentric seconds) | 1.8–2.8 s | 1.4–1.79 s | 1.0–1.39 s | 0.6–0.99 s | <0.6 s |
| **Ascent tempo** (concentric seconds) | 1.0–2.0 s | 0.7–0.99 s | 0.5–0.69 s | 0.3–0.49 s | <0.3 s |
| **Pause at bottom** | 0.5–1.5 s | 0.3–0.49 s | <0.3 s | — | — |

### 1.3 Side Camera (Left or Right) — Target Ranges

*Sagittal-plane metrics are primary here. Valgus cannot be assessed from side view.*

| Parameter | Excellent | Good | Mild deviation | Moderate deviation | Severe deviation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Knee angle at bottom** (interior °) | 45–70° | 70–90° | 90–110° | 110–140° | 140°+ |
| **Trunk lean from vertical** (°) | 5–20° | 20–30° | 30–40° | 40–50° | 50°+ |
| **Ankle dorsiflexion** (shin from vert.) | ≥ 30° | 20–29° | 10–19° | 0–9° | <0° / heel lifting |
| **Descent tempo** (eccentric seconds) | 1.8–2.8 s | 1.4–1.79 s | 1.0–1.39 s | 0.6–0.99 s | <0.6 s |
| **Ascent tempo** (concentric seconds) | 1.0–2.0 s | 0.7–0.99 s | 0.5–0.69 s | 0.3–0.49 s | <0.3 s |
| **Pause at bottom** | 0.5–1.5 s | 0.3–0.49 s | <0.3 s | — | — |
| **Hip hinge pattern** | Hips track back slightly then directly down | Mostly vertical path | Forward-biased path | Pronounced forward lean from top | Good-morning pattern |

**Conventional flexion equivalents (for cross-check with image):**

| Depth level | MediaPipe interior | Conventional flexion |
|---|---|---|
| Full depth (ATG) | 45–70° | 110–135° |
| Parallel (hip = knee) | 70–90° | 90–110° |
| Just above parallel | 90–110° | 70–90° |
| Quarter squat | 110–140° | 40–70° |
| Barely bent | 140°+ | <40° |

**JSON format for S2 injection (side camera):**
```json

### 1.4 Metric Validity by Camera Angle

| Metric | Front | Angled | Side (L or R) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Knee depth angle | ✅ readable | ✅ readable | ✅ most reliable |
| Trunk lean | ✅ readable | ✅ readable | ✅ most reliable |
| Ankle dorsiflexion | ⚠️ less reliable (wider bands; confirm with heel lift + valgus) | ⚠️ less reliable | ✅ most reliable |
| Knee valgus (gap ratio) | ✅ primary metric | ✅ readable | ❌ not assessable |
| Hip height asymmetry | ✅ primary metric | ⚠️ partial | ❌ not assessable |
| Lateral trunk shift | ✅ primary metric | ⚠️ partial | ❌ not assessable |
| Ascent pattern (good morning) | ⚠️ partial | ⚠️ partial | ✅ most reliable |
| Heel rise | ⚠️ partial | ⚠️ partial | ✅ most reliable |

**Rule:** When a metric is marked ❌ for the session's camera angle, do not score or comment on it.
When marked ⚠️, use only if the deviation is large (≥ moderate range) and cross-confirmed with the 8-frame image.

### 1.5 Severity Scale — Deviations from Gold Standard

| Deviation from target range | Severity | Penalty |
|---|---|---|
| Within target range | No fault | 0 pts |
| 1–8° outside range (or 0.02–0.05 ratio deviation) | Mild | −8 pts |
| 8–18° outside range (or 0.05–0.15 ratio) | Moderate | −15 pts |
| >18° outside range (or >0.15 ratio) | Severe | −25 pts |

## PART 2 — ROOT CAUSE TAXONOMY & DRILLS

### RC1 — Ankle Dorsiflexion Restriction *(most common root cause)*

**Signature:**
- Shin angle < 30° (side camera) or < 25° (front camera) at the bottom of the squat
- Forward lean compensating for restricted ankle mobility
- Heel rise on descent or at bottom
- Possible: knee valgus as a downstream compensation

**Severity thresholds (primary — side camera):**
- Mild restriction: 20–29° shin angle from vertical — parallel achievable with compensation
- Moderate restriction: 10–19° — cannot reach parallel heels-flat
- Severe restriction: < 10° or visible heel lift — heels rise immediately

**Front camera:** Use 2-tier only (good ≥25° / restricted <25°). Confirm severity with heel lift visibility and valgus ratio — do not apply graded severity from front-camera shin angle alone.

**Causal chain:** Restricted ankle → shin cannot track forward → hips forced to shift back or torso leans forward → depth becomes insufficient OR trunk leans excessively → can cause valgus as a tertiary compensation

**Key rule:** If forward lean + depth deficit + valgus are all present in the same session → check ankle first. If ankle is restricted, this is ONE root cause driving all three symptoms. Apply one penalty to range_of_motion_score. Do NOT penalise forward lean and depth separately.

**Within-set cue:**
> "Next rep: focus on pushing your knees out and forward over your pinky toe as you sit down. Keep your heels firmly on the floor the entire way."

**Drills — Next Session:**
1. **Banded ankle circles** — 20 reps each foot before squatting. Loop a band around the ankle and around a rack, then move the knee in circles while keeping the heel down.
2. **Wall ankle stretch** — face a wall, toes 5cm away, knee touches wall without heel lifting. Move foot back until you can just touch. 3×30s each side.
3. **Heel-elevated goblet squats (3×8)** — elevate heels 1.5–2.5cm on plates or a wedge. Same weight as session. This allows depth practice while the ankle mobility is being developed. Reduce elevation over 4–6 weeks as mobility improves.
4. **Calf/soleus SMR** — 60-second foam roll each calf before squatting. Focus on the lower calf (soleus), not just the belly of gastrocnemius.

**Coaching language — ankle restriction:**
> "Your shin angle is [X]° — good mobility starts at 30° (the target for a comfortable, full-depth squat). At [X]°, your ankle isn't allowing the shin to track far enough forward over your foot. To compensate, either your heel wants to rise, or your torso leans forward. Both limit depth and shift load onto your lower back instead of your quads and glutes."

---

### RC2 — Glute / Hip Abductor Weakness

**Signature:**
- Knee gap / hip gap ratio < 0.95 (front/angled camera)
- Knees cave inward (valgus), especially on ascent
- Pattern: valgus worsening in later reps = fatigue-driven weakness

**Severity thresholds:**
- Mild: ratio 0.85–0.94
- Moderate: ratio 0.70–0.84
- Severe: ratio < 0.70

**Causal chain:** Weak glutes/abductors → insufficient lateral force to keep knees tracking over toes → knees collapse inward during descent and especially on ascent drive

**Key rule:** Distinguish from RC1-driven valgus. If valgus appears only in later reps (from rep 5+) with clean reps 1–4 → RC2 (fatigue). If valgus is present from rep 1 alongside ankle restriction → likely RC1 causing both.

**Within-set cue:**
> "Next rep: as you start to stand back up, actively push your knees outward — think about spreading the floor apart with your feet. Squeeze your glutes hard at the top."

**Drills — Next Session:**
1. **Banded goblet squats (3×8–10)** — place a light resistance band just above the knees. The band provides tactile feedback; push against it throughout the set. Use the same weight.
2. **Clamshells (2×15 each side)** — lying on side, feet together, knees at 45°, rotate top knee upward. Add a band above the knee for progression.
3. **Lateral band walks (2×12 each direction)** — band above knees, slight hip hinge, walk laterally maintaining hip width. Keep toes forward.
4. **Glute bridge (3×12)** — drive through heels, full hip extension at top, 2-second hold. Progress to single-leg if bodyweight is easy.

**Metric note — distance vs ratio:**
The biomechanics JSON passes two equivalent fields for valgus. Use the ratio for severity grading against the thresholds above:
- `knee_gap_hip_gap_ratio` — use this for severity grading (matches the thresholds above)
- `knee_valgus_distance` — alternative format: distance ≈ 1 − ratio (e.g. distance 0.20 = ratio 0.80 = moderate)
- `valgus_severity` — pre-computed grade (none / mild / moderate / severe) — use this directly

**Side camera — valgus handling:**
Valgus cannot be assessed from a side-facing camera (frontal-plane measurement, not visible from the side). `stability_data` will be null for side-camera sessions.
- Do NOT score or comment on valgus from side-camera sessions.
- Exception: if RC1 (ankle restriction) is confirmed, note valgus as a *potential downstream risk* only: *"Ankle restriction at this level often causes knees to cave inward on the ascent — a front-camera session would confirm whether this is happening."* Do not assign a severity score.

**Coaching language — valgus / glute weakness:**
> "Your knee gap / hip gap ratio averaged [X] — the target is ≥0.95. What this means: your knees are tracking [X cm/degree] inside your hip line at the bottom. This shifts shear force onto the inner knee structures and reduces power transfer from your glutes. The fix is targeted abductor and glute work outside of squatting, not just cueing during the set."

---

### RC3 — Hip Flexor Tightness / Hip Mobility Deficit

**Signature (side camera best for this):**
- Butt wink at the bottom (posterior pelvic tilt, lumbar rounding)
- Hips rise faster than shoulders on ascent ("good morning" pattern)
- Trunk lean that appears predominantly at the hip, not the ankle

**Severity thresholds:**
- Mild: pelvic tilt only at very bottom, spine mostly neutral
- Moderate: pelvic tilt beginning before parallel depth
- Severe: consistent good-morning pattern throughout ascent

**Causal chain:** Tight hip flexors / limited hip internal rotation → pelvis tilts posteriorly under load → lumbar spine rounds to compensate → either limits depth or creates back-dominant ascent pattern

**Key rule:** Only flag RC3 if forward lean is present WITHOUT ankle restriction. If both ankle restriction and forward lean are present, RC1 is the primary cause. RC3 acts independently when the shin angle is adequate (≥20°) but lean/butt-wink still occurs.

**Within-set cue:**
> "Next rep: as you hit the bottom, brace your core hard and think 'chest up' before you drive up. Hips and shoulders should rise together — don't let your hips shoot first."

**Drills — Next Session:**
1. **Hip flexor stretch (kneeling)** — lunge position, rear knee on floor, push hips forward while keeping torso tall. 3×45s each side before squatting.
2. **90/90 hip stretch** — seated, one leg in front (90°), one behind (90°), rotate toward front leg while keeping chest tall. 2×60s each side.
3. **Goblet squat with pause at bottom (3×6)** — same weight, sit into the bottom for 3 seconds, focus on keeping lumbar neutral. This builds the hip mobility pattern under load.
4. **Dead bugs (2×10 each side)** — anti-extension core work to support pelvic control under the squat load.

**Coaching language — hip mobility:**
> "Your hips are rising ahead of your shoulders on the way up — this is a 'good morning' pattern. At a [trunk lean]° lean, the movement is shifting load from your quads and glutes to your lower back and hamstrings. The root cause is hip flexor tightness limiting full hip flexion at depth, which forces the pelvis to tip back and the torso to follow."

---

### RC4 — Load-Relative Strength Deficit

**Signature:**
- Form is clean in reps 1–3, deteriorates progressively across the set
- NOT a mobility or stability issue — technique is present when fresh

**Severity thresholds:**
- Mild: deterioration in final 1–2 reps only
- Moderate: deterioration from rep 4–5 onward
- Severe: deterioration from rep 2–3

**Causal chain:** Weight is above current strength threshold for full-set quality → muscular fatigue causes progressive breakdown in depth, posture, or stability

**Key rule:** This is a weight selection issue ONLY. Do NOT prescribe corrective exercises — the athlete has the movement. Recommendation = reduce weight by 10–20% next set to maintain quality across the full set. If set_number is 2nd or 3rd and rep count is high (8+), late-rep breakdown is more likely fatigue than RC4 — note this distinction.

**Within-set cue:**
> "Next set: drop the weight by 2–4kg and focus on maintaining the form quality you had in rep 1 all the way through the last rep."

**Drills — Next Session:**
1. No corrective exercises needed. Weight selection recommendation only.
2. Reduce load by 10–20% for next set. Increase weight only when form holds for ALL reps.
3. If this is a later set (2nd or 3rd): consider this fatigue from the earlier sets rather than pure load deficit. Allow additional rest (90–120s) before the next set rather than reducing weight.

**Coaching language — load deficit:**
> "Reps 1–[X] look strong — good depth, upright torso. From rep [Y] onward, [specific deterioration]. This isn't a technique problem; you have the movement pattern. The weight is slightly above your current capacity to hold that standard for the full set. Reduce by [X kg] next set and see if you can maintain rep 1 quality all the way through."

---

### RC5 — Thoracic Spine / Upper Back Mobility *(rare in goblet squat)*

**Signature:**
- Upper back rounding and chest dropping forward
- Trunk lean is concentrated in upper thoracic region, not hip
- Shoulder rounding, elbows dropping

**Note:** The goblet squat's front-loaded counterbalance naturally promotes an upright torso. RC5 is only present when:
1. Ankle dorsiflexion is adequate (≥20°) — RC1 not responsible for lean
2. Hip mobility is adequate — RC3 not responsible
3. A distinct upper-back rounding pattern is visible in the 8-frame image

**Severity thresholds:**
- Mild: slight upper back rounding at depth only
- Moderate: chest drop from standing to bottom throughout
- Severe: significant kyphosis, elbows cannot maintain cup-of-dumbbell position

**Within-set cue:**
> "Next rep: before you descend, take a big breath in, brace your core, and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Keep your elbows pointing down throughout — don't let them flare."

**Drills — Next Session:**
1. **Thoracic spine foam roll (60s)** — extension over the roller at mid-back, 5–6 positions from lower-thoracic to upper-thoracic.
2. **Cat-cow (2×10 slow)** — controlled lumbar and thoracic segmental movement to open the spine before loading.
3. **Wall slide (2×10)** — stand with back against wall, arms in goalpost, slide arms overhead while maintaining contact. Builds thoracic extension under load.
4. **Reduce weight slightly** — use a lighter load to allow bracing and positioning before adding load again.

**Coaching language — thoracic mobility:**
> "The forward lean is concentrated in your upper back rather than your hips — your chest is dropping forward, not your hips shooting back. The goblet squat's front load should naturally counterbalance this, but limited thoracic extension is preventing you from keeping your chest up through the full range."

## PART 3 — PER-PARAMETER COACHING LANGUAGE

### 3.1 Range of Motion (weight: 35%)

**What to affirm when good:**
- "Depth is consistent — hip crease below knee on [X] of [Y] reps."
- "Knee angle averaged [X]° — you're hitting full depth on every rep. That's exactly where your glutes switch on fully."
- "Depth held through the final reps — you're maintaining quality under fatigue, which is the harder part."

**What to observe when limited:**
- "Knee angle averaged [X]° — your hips stayed above your knees. The target for full depth is below 90° (MediaPipe). At [X]°, your quads and glutes aren't getting the full stimulus they need."
- "Depth was inconsistent — reps [X, Y] reached [A]° but reps [Z, W] only reached [B]°. Fatigue is cutting the range short in later reps."
- "Ankle dorsiflexion measured [X]° — the target is ≥20°. At [X]°, your shin can't track forward enough to allow full depth without compensating somewhere else."

**Feedback language:**
- Pair the angle with the physical consequence, then give the fix.
- Never say "you need to go deeper" without explaining why depth matters for this individual.

---

### 3.2 Stability (weight: 25%)

**What to affirm when good:**
- "Knee tracking is solid — your knees stayed in line with your toes throughout."
- "Lateral stability is consistent — no trunk shift detected across all reps."
- "Valgus ratio [X] — knees are tracking at hip width or wider. Good control."

**What to observe when limited:**
- "Knee gap / hip gap ratio averaged [X] — your knees are tracking inside your hips at the bottom. Target is ≥0.95. At [X] ratio, you're getting medial knee loading on every rep."
- "Valgus appeared in reps [X, Y, Z] — [early/mid/late] phase of each rep. The pattern [worsening in later reps / consistent from rep 1] suggests [fatigue-driven weakness / positional habit]."
- "Lateral trunk shift of approximately [X] cm was visible — this suggests one hip is compensating for the other."

---

### 3.3 Posture (weight: 25%)

**What to affirm when good:**
- "Torso stayed upright — trunk lean averaged [X]°, which is excellent for a goblet squat."
- "Lumbar position held neutral throughout — no butt wink detected."
- "Core bracing looked solid — torso angle stayed consistent rep to rep."

**What to observe when limited:**
- "Trunk lean reached [X]° by rep [Y] — the ideal range is 5–20° (side camera) or 5–18° (front). At [X]°, your lower back is taking over from your glutes and quads as the primary driver."
- "Butt wink appeared at the bottom position — your pelvis is tilting posteriorly at depth, which increases lumbar flexion under load."
- "Trunk lean is increasing as the set progresses — reps 1–3 averaged [A]°, reps [B–C] averaged [D]°. Fatigue is reducing the thoracic bracing that keeps you upright."

---

### 3.4 Movement Quality (weight: 15%)

**What to affirm when good:**
- "Descent control is excellent — [X]s average is exactly the target range."
- "Ascent is smooth — no hips-first pattern detected."
- "Tempo is consistent across all reps — you're not rushing under fatigue."

**What to observe when limited:**
- "Descent averaged [X]s — the target is 1.8–2.8s. At [X]s, you're lowering too quickly to build eccentric tension, which reduces the strength stimulus and makes the bottom position harder to control."
- "Ascent averaged [X]s — faster than the target range. The initial drive is hips-first, which shifts load to the posterior chain and away from the quads."
- "Tempo dropped in later reps — descent went from [A]s in reps 1–3 to [B]s in reps [X–Y]. Fatigue is causing you to rush through the harder part of the movement."

---

## PART 4 — WITHIN-SET CUES (ready-to-use by parameter)

These are single, specific cues the athlete can apply **on the very next rep or next set within the same session**. Use exactly one cue that targets the primary root cause.

### Depth / Range of Motion Cues
- "Sit *down*, not back — keep your weight balanced across your whole foot."
- "Find the floor with your heels before you descend, then stay there."
- "Think about your hip crease dropping below your kneecap — that's the target position."
- "On the way down, count two seconds minimum before you change direction."
- "Push your knees apart over your pinky toe as you sit — this creates space for your hips."

### Stability / Valgus Cues
- "Spread the floor apart with your feet — external rotation thought, even if your feet don't move."
- "Push your knees out over your little toe the moment you start to rise."
- "Squeeze your glutes hard before you push up — don't let the knees lead the movement."
- "Imagine you're trying to widen the space between your knees throughout the whole rep."

### Posture / Torso Cues
- "Big breath in at the top, brace hard before you descend — stay braced until you're back up."
- "Keep the weight between your hands at chest height, not drifting down to your belly."
- "Chest up — think about showing the logo on your shirt to someone in front of you."
- "On the ascent: chest and hips rise together — not hips first."

### Tempo / Movement Quality Cues
- "Slow the descent to a 2-count — don't drop into the bottom."
- "Pause one full second at the bottom before driving up."
- "Drive through both heels equally on the way up — feel the floor."

## PART 6 — VERDICT LANGUAGE GUIDE

Map `overall_form_score` to a verdict label and opening line:

| Score range | Verdict label | Opening tone |
|---|---|---|
| 90–100 | "Excellent Form" | Lead with genuine affirmation — this is rare and deserves recognition |
| 75–89 | "Maintain" | Affirm what's working strongly, note one area to refine |
| 60–74 | "Good Work" | Acknowledge the positives, address one clear issue as the next step |
| 40–59 | "Improve" | Honest about the issue, specific root cause, clear corrective path |
| 25–39 | "Needs Focus" | Prioritise safety and form reset — reduce weight, address root cause first |

**Verdict sentence starters by label:**
- **Excellent Form:** "This is clean — [specific strength]. Keep this standard and you can consider adding [5 kg / next progression]."
- **Maintain:** "Depth and [parameter] are solid. The one thing to refine for the next set is [specific cue]."
- **Good Work:** "[Genuine positive]. [Root cause] is limiting [outcome] — here's the one thing to address."
- **Improve:** "[Positive]. [Fault] at [angle vs target] is the main limiter — it's fixable. Here's the priority."
- **Needs Focus:** "Let's get the form right before adding weight. [Root cause] is affecting [X, Y, Z]. Drop to [weight] next set and focus on [one thing]."

---

## PART 7 — PAIN PROTOCOL

If `user_pain_level` ≥ 4 (on a 0–10 scale), prepend this note to the coaching_output.verdict before any other content:

> "You reported [X]/10 pain [location/type from user report]. At this level, I'd recommend stopping and resting rather than continuing the set. If you do continue, keep the weight light and stop immediately if the pain increases or changes location. Consult a physio or medical professional before your next session if the pain persists."

If `user_pain_level` is 1–3:
> "You noted some [discomfort/tightness] at [X]/10. Keep an eye on it — if it increases during the set, stop. The coaching below assumes this is mild and you can continue safely."

If `user_pain_level` is 0 or null: no pain note needed.

---

## PART 8 — CAUSAL CHAIN DECISION TREE

Use this tree before assigning root causes and penalties:

```
Is ankle dorsiflexion < 20° (front) or < 20° (side)?
├── YES → RC1 is primary
│   ├── Is forward lean also present? → RC1 causes it. ONE penalty on ROM.
│   ├── Is depth insufficient? → RC1 causes it. Covered by same penalty.
│   └── Is valgus present from rep 1? → Likely RC1 driving it. No additional penalty.
│       └── Is valgus WORSENING in later reps despite adequate ankle? → Add RC2 (independent).
└── NO → Ankle is not the root cause
    ├── Is forward lean present? → Check thoracic (RC5) via image
    │   └── Is butt wink present? → RC3 (hip flexor tightness)
    ├── Is valgus present? → RC2 (abductor weakness)
    │   ├── Worsens in later reps? → RC2 fatigue pattern
    │   └── Present from rep 1? → RC2 positional habit
    └── Is form clean in reps 1–3 but deteriorating by rep 5+? → RC4 (load deficit)
        └── Is this 2nd or 3rd set? → Consider cumulative fatigue, not RC4
```

**Multiple independent root causes:** If two separate root causes are confirmed (e.g., RC1 + RC2 independently, each with distinct signatures), apply a penalty to each affected parameter score separately. Maximum total deduction across parameters = −35 points.

## PART 9 — CONSISTENCY BONUS RULES

Apply +5 points to `overall_form_score` only when BOTH:
1. `rep_count ≥ 7`
2. `max(rep_scores) − min(rep_scores) < 10 points`

This rewards athletes who maintain quality under fatigue across a full working set. Do not apply the bonus if the set has fewer than 7 reps — short sets do not test fatigue resilience.

When the bonus applies, note it explicitly in the verdict:
> "Form quality was remarkably consistent across all [X] reps — that earns a consistency bonus and is a genuine sign of well-developed movement patterns."

## PART 10 — SOURCES & EVIDENCE BASE

Angle targets and severity thresholds are derived from:
- **Straub et al., IJSPT 2024** — goblet squat biomechanics under load
- **PMC4727299** — ankle dorsiflexion and knee valgus correlation
- **PMC4415844, PMC4264643** — squat depth and patellofemoral loading
- **PubMed 24380805** — frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) and valgus
- **NASM Squat Biomechanics guidelines**
- **E3Rehab ankle dorsiflexion clinical norms**
- **Swolverine / InspireUS goblet squat form guides**
- **NSC/NSCA strength and conditioning squat standards**

*Ranges represent the documented range of good form in trained individuals — not a single target value. The system will expand reference data as more validated sessions are added.*
